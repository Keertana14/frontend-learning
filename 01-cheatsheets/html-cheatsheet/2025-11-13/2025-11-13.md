### **Self Closing Tags and Images**

#### **Regular Tags:**
Regular HTML tag requires an opening and closing tag to wrap a content. 
ex: Paragraph tag: <p> I'm Paragraph </p>
---
#### **Self Closing Tags: (Void Elements)**
Self closing tag are the tags itself are the elements with no content to wrap. There are 2 types of sytax's that can be used:
- only the tag name wrapped in angle brackets: <hr>
- the tag name can be ended with forward slash: </hr>

**Full list of self-closing tags:**
```
<hr>
<br>
<img>
<source>
<meta>
<param>
<input>
<link>
<col>
<embed>
<area>
<base>
<track>
<wbr>
```
---
### **HR and BR Tags**
- HR Tag : hr - Horizontal Rule: The hr tag creates a horizontal line between the contents
- BR Tag: br - Line Break - The br tag will create a line break between the contents
---
### **Images:**
Images add visual identity essential for branding and can aid in illustrating concepts easily
img tag: 
it has two attributes source (src) and alterantive (alt) attribute:
src: points to the actual image file
alt: text description of image, used by browser for two main purpose:
- first, for screen readers which is assistive software that translates on screen info to speech enabling visualy impared people to interact with the computers 
- second, is for SEO search engine optimization, alt text allows search engines like google to properly index images
---
#### **Image Formats:**

**Bitmap Images:**
- Bitmap images are also called as Raster images
- they are made from a grid of pixels with each pixel assigned a color value
- they are resolution dependent, the quality and clarity of the image are directly tied to the pixel dimension which cause pixelation issue (the quality of image will be lost)
- used for photographs 
- common format includes jpeg and png
- bitmap images is embedded into html, we always has to reference either an absolute or relative URL for bitmap image

**Vector Images**
- these images are made by mathematical equations and instructions for rendering shapes, paths and colors
- they are resolution independent
- vectors are commonly used for smaller images like logos and icons
- common formats for vector images are svg (scalable vector graphics), AI (Adobe Illustrator)

**svg tag:**
- attributes: stroke-width, fill
- path self closing tag: path tag has an attribute that plots the shapes and line path of the svg
- we will download svg from other place and rearly write on our own

using svg: there are 2 options:
- **inline:** svg code is used directly inside html code.
- **img:** use an image element and reference an svg
---
### **HTML Forms:**
Forms collect and submit user provided data and send it to the web server for processing.
**Form tag:** 
```
<form action="/api/v1/journals/ method="post"> Form Elements </form>
```
- action attribute: specifies the location on the server where the form data will be sent for processing
- method attribute: determines the http method used for handling the form data (get, put, post, delete)

**Form Elements:** Form acts as a container for various form elements that allow users to input different types of data. There are 3 main elements:
- Input: text inputs for the name
- Dropdown: select from a pre-defined list
- text area: user can enter data here

#### **Input Types**:
**Textual Inputs:**
- Text
- Password
- Email
- Date
- Tel
- number

**Binary Inputs:**
- Checkbox
- Radio

**File Inputs**

**Miscellaneous**
- Range
- Color

**Input tag:**
```
<input type="text" name="user-email" placeholder="enter title">
```
- **type Attribute:** specifies the type of the attribute
- **name attribute:** assign identifier for the data collection, required when sending data to the server
- **placeholder:** an example text that appears inside the input box before the user types anything
other attributes that can be used: maxlength, required, disabled
---
#### **label tag:**
- **id attribute:** identifies the element using unique value
- **for attribute:** specifically used in html forms, Connects the label to the input with the matching id
- *id and for attribute should be same*
```
<input id="main-title" type="text" name="user-email" placeholder="enter title">
<label for="main-title"> Journal Title </label>
```
---
#### **Text Area**
An element used for multiline text inputs used  for comments and longer messages. Text area has an opening tag and a closing tag.
- **id:** identifies the element using unique value
- **for:** connects the label to the textarea with the matching id
- **name:** the name that will be sent in a form submission
- **rows:** Sets height of textarea in lines (5 lines tall)
- **cols:** Sets width of textarea in average character units (40 characters wide)
- **placeholder:** Gray hint text shown before typing.
```
<label for="msg">Message:</label>
<textarea id="msg" name="msg" rows="5" cols="40" placeholder="Type your message..."></textarea>
```
### **Dropdowns:**
**select and option tags:**
- In forms we allow user to select a category
- **name:** the value selected by the user will be sent under this name when the form is submitted
- **id:** identifies the element using unique value linking with a label
- The option tag is used inside a select dropdown
- **option value:** the actual data sent to the server when the form is submitted
- **selected:** Pre-selects this option by default when the page loads
- **disabled:** The user cannot select this option, used for placeholder-like messages
```
<select id="course" name="course">
            <option value="" disabled selected>Select a course</option>
            <option value="html">HTML</option>
            <option value="css">CSS</option>
            <option value="js">JavaScript</option>
</select>
```
#### **Buttons:**
Buttons are clickable elements used to perform actions such as
- Submitting a form
- Resetting a form

Buttons can appear in several forms:
```
<button>
<input type="submit">
<input type="reset">
<input type="button">
```
#### **The button Tag:**
The button tag creates a clickable button in HTML
**Submit Button:** Sends the form data to the server
```
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
```
**Reset Button:** Clears the form inputs back to their default values
```
<button type="reset">Reset</button>
```
**Normal Button:**  Does nothing unless JavaScript is attached
```
<button type="button">Click</button>
```
#### **Buttons vs. Hyperlinks**
Buttons and Hyperlinks can appear visually the same, but serves different purposes.
- Buttons are used to trigger actions
- Hyperlinks are used for navigation, to navigate to different page

#### **Checkbox and Radio Buttons:**
Checkbox allow users to select one or more(multiple) options from a predefined list
- **type:** Specifies the input type
- **name:** Groups related inputs, multiple values are allowed under the same name
- **value:** The data sent to the server when this option is selected, If no value is given, browsers send "on" by default
- **checked:** Pre-selects (checks) the option when the page loads
- **disabled:** Forces the user to select at least one radio option, For checkboxes, it only works if a single checkbox must be checked
- **id:** Used to link the input with a label
```
<label>
  <input type="checkbox" name="skills" value="html" checked> HTML
</label>

<label>
  <input type="checkbox" name="skills" value="css" disabled> CSS
</label>

<label>
  <input type="checkbox" name="skills" value="js"> JavaScript
</label>
```
Radio buttons allows the user to select only ONE option from a pre-defined list
- **type:** Specifies the input type
- **name:** Groups related inputs,  very important for radio buttons (only 1 can be selected within the same name)
- **value:** The data sent to the server when this option is selected, If no value is given, browsers send "on" by default
- **checked:** Pre-selects (checks) the option when the page loads
- **disabled:** Forces the user to select at least one radio option, For checkboxes, it only works if a single checkbox must be checked
```
<label>
  <input type="radio" name="gender" value="male"> Male
</label>

<label>
  <input type="radio" name="gender" value="female" checked> Female
</label>

<label>
  <input type="radio" name="gender" value="other" disabled> Other
</label>
```
### **Form Validation:**
Validation means checking whether the data a user enters into a form is correct, complete, in the proper format and safe
- **Client-Side Validation:** This validation happens in the browser before sending data to the server. Done using HTML attribute, javascript or browser's in built rules
- **Server-Side Validation:** This validation happens on the server after the form is submitted. Done using PHP, Node.js, Python, Java, etc.
- **Inbuilt vs Custom Validation:** In Inbuilt (Browser Built-In) Validation, the browser automatically validates based on HTML attributes. But in Custom Validation, we write your own validation rules using JavaScript or backend code.

### **Form Submission:** 
Form needs to know how to and where to send data. 
-When you submit a form, the browser collects all inputs that have a same attribute and this is called form encoding
- For form encoding, The format depends on the form’s method and enctype
- then the browser sends the http request (get, put, post, delete)
- On the server, The server reads the body, extracts the key/value pairs and then it performs the action either save to database, authenticate user, show response page or redirect
- After processing, the server responds back

## Containers and Semantic HTML:
### Block and Inline Elements:
All HTML elements are by default block or inline element
- Block element starts on a new line as they take up full width of a page
- they can contain other block or inline elements
- they start vertically
- ex: headings, paragraphs, unordered and ordered list, div, section, header, footer, form, table
- Inline elements do not start on a new line
- the block element takes up full width so it pushes the inline element to a new line
- inline elements only occupy the width of there content
- Cannot contain block elements (only inline elements)
- ex: anchor tag, images, line breaks, span, label and inputs
- An inline element can be nested inside a block element
- an anchor tag inside a list
```
<ul>
    <li><a href="login.html"></a></li>
</ul>
```
- Placing a block element inside inline element is not valid, that means an inline element can have only inline element, the below example is not valid.
```
<a href="login.html">
    <h1> Login </h1>
</a>
```
---
## Containers:
- A container is simply an HTML element whose main purpose is to hold other elements inside it. A container groups content and is used in conjunction with css to control the positioning and styling of the content blocks.
---
### Block Containers
- section tag
- div tag
- article tag
- header tag
- footer tag
- main tag
- nav tag
### div tag:
div element is the block level container element used to group content for stylying and positioning, it would take up the full width of the page and force any content below it in html document to start on the new line.
```
<div>
    <h2>Title</h2>
    <p>Some content...</p>
</div>
```
---
## Inline Containers
An inline level container element most commonly is used to style a portion of text (for small text grouping)
### span tag
span tag is used to apply CSS or JavaScript to part of a text, it is an inline element and doesn't start in new line
```
<h1> What will you <span style="color: pink"> design </span> today? </h1>
```
---
### difference between div and span
| div | span |
|-------|-----|
| used to group larger blocks of html content for styling and positioning  | primarily used to wrap text for custom styling |
| block level element | inline level element |

## Semantic HTML
Semantic HTML means using HTML elements that describe the meaning and purpose of the content, instead of just how it looks.
Semantic = meaningful.
The reasons to use semantic HTML:
- **Accessibility:** it helps the users with disabilities who rely on screen readers and other assistive technology
- **SEO:** SEO stands for *Search Engine Optimization* it improves search engine rankings by helping search engines better index web page content
- **Cleaner code:** it creates clean and structured code that you and other developers can more easily understand
These tags tell the browser, developers, screen readers, and search engines what each part of the webpage represents.
Semantic HTML elements:
- describe the meaning of your content
- improve SEO, accessibility, and readability
- replace generic <div> with meaningful tags like <header>, <main>, <section>, etc.

 ## Scientific HTML
 #### Scientific HTML Tables
**What is a table?**
A table displays information in grid format arranging data by rows and columns.
**Table Elements:**
`<table>` — The table container: Holds all table content.
`<tr>` — Table Row: Defines a row of cells.
`<th>` — Table Header Cell: Bold,  Centered (by default), Semantically a heading: Used for column titles or row headers.
`<td>` — Table Data Cell: Contains normal table data.
`<thead>` — Group of header rows (top)
`<tbody>` — Group of content rows
`<tfoot>` — Footer rows (summary totals)
`<caption>` — Title/label describing the table
`<colgroup>` — Group of columns for styling
`<col>` — Defines styling/width for individual columns
colspan — Merge Columns (Horizontal Merge): An attribute that specifies the number of columns a cell should span horizontally
rowspan — Merge Rows (Vertical Merge): An attribute that specifies the number of rows a cell should span vertically
---
### Subscript and Superscript
`<sub>` — Subscript: Used for chemical formulas, math, scientific units.
```
H<sub>2</sub>O
CO<sub>2</sub>
```
`<sup>` — Superscript: Used for exponents, scientific notation, footnotes.
```
E = mc<sup>2</sup>
10<sup>-6</sup>
```
---
### figure and figcaption
`<figure>` tag:
The `<figure>` tag is a semantic container used to group media content and its caption. 
It is used for:
- images
- diagrams
- charts
- code snippets
- illustrations
- graphs
- scientific visuals

The `<figure>` element is independent from the main content — meaning it can be moved without affecting the document meaning.

`<figcaption>` tag:
The `<figcaption>` tag is used to provide a caption or description for the `<figure>`
This caption:
- describes the image/media
- gives context
- improves accessibility
- helps search engines understand the content

`<figcaption>` must be placed inside `<figure>`.
```
<figure>
    <img src="moon.jpg" alt="Full moon in the night sky">
    <figcaption>The full moon captured at midnight.</figcaption>
</figure>
```

## Evolution of Tables in HTML
Early Web (1990s–early 2000s): Tables for Layout
Before CSS existed, web developers used tables to build entire page layouts:
- multi-column pages
- navigation menus
- sidebars
- page structure

This was not semantic and caused:
- accessibility issues
- messy code
- difficulty maintaining layouts

Modern Web (After CSS introduction)
CSS brought:
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Responsive design
- Semantic layout tags

So tables are now used only for scientific/tabular data, not layouts.
Modern Best Practice
- Use tables ONLY for data.
- Use CSS Flex / Grid for layouts.
