#### **Image Formats:**

**Bitmap Images:**
- Bitmap images are also called as Raster images
- they are made from a grid of pixels with each pixel assigned a color value
- they are resolution dependent, the quality and clarity of the image are directly tied to the pixel dimension which cause pixelation issue (the quality of image will be lost)
- used for photographs 
- common format includes jpeg and png
- bitmap images is embedded into html, we always has to reference either an absolute or relative URL for bitmap image

**Vector Images**
- these images are made by mathematical equations and instructions for rendering shapes, paths and colors
- they are resolution independent
- vectors are commonly used for smaller images like logos and icons
- common formats for vector images are svg (scalable vector graphics), AI (Adobe Illustrator)

**svg tag:**
- attributes: stroke-width, fill
- path self closing tag: path tag has an attribute that plots the shapes and line path of the svg
- we will download svg from other place and rearly write on our own

using svg: there are 2 options:
- **inline:** svg code is used directly inside html code.
- **img:** use an image element and reference an svg

### **Form Validation:**
Validation means checking whether the data a user enters into a form is correct, complete, in the proper format and safe
- **Client-Side Validation:** This validation happens in the browser before sending data to the server. Done using HTML attribute, javascript or browser's in built rules
- **Server-Side Validation:** This validation happens on the server after the form is submitted. Done using PHP, Node.js, Python, Java, etc.
- **Inbuilt vs Custom Validation:** In Inbuilt (Browser Built-In) Validation, the browser automatically validates based on HTML attributes. But in Custom Validation, we write your own validation rules using JavaScript or backend code.

### **Form Submission:** 
Form needs to know how to and where to send data. 
-When you submit a form, the browser collects all inputs that have a same attribute and this is called form encoding
- For form encoding, The format depends on the form’s method and enctype
- then the browser sends the http request (get, put, post, delete)
- On the server, The server reads the body, extracts the key/value pairs and then it performs the action either save to database, authenticate user, show response page or redirect
- After processing, the server responds back
